MutateMe is a Mutation Testing framework for PHP5, currently released as an
alpha version for interested developers to assist in offering feedback. It is
not yet fully functional, and stability is a relative term :).

Requirements:

PHP: 5.2.4
PEAR: Text_Diff 1.1.0
Extensions: ext/runkit, and optionally ext/xdiff

Note: Do not install runkit from PECL since the current release does not support
PHP 5.2. Follow the installation instructions below to grab the
latest copy from CVS instead.

Installation (Manual Installation without PEAR):

1. Copy the contents of /library to a location on the PHP include_path, e.g.
   /usr/share/php.

2. Copy /bin/mutateme and /bin/mutateme.bat to a location on PATH so they are
   accessible from the command line. Edit the contents of each to replace @php_bin@,
   @bin_dir@ with the path to the php binary (e.g. /usr/bin/php) and the path to the
   directory you're putting these scripts respectively.

3. Install the runkit extension but NOT from PECL. Windows users can grab the DLL
   from http://dev.phpspec.org/php_runkit.dll, Linux users can compile the extension
   from the latest CVS HEAD using the following commands:
   
   cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository login
   cvs -d:pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository co pecl/runkit
   cd runkit
   phpize
   ./configure
   make
   make install

   Finally, enable the extension in the php.ini file which is loaded for the cli
   environment using:

   extension=runkit.so

   Check the output of "php -i" or phpinfo() to ensure the extension is loaded.

Usage:
   
MutateMe has just a few necessary command line options:

   --adapter    Adapter to use: phpunit or simpletest. PHPUnit is the default.
   --basedir    Base directory containing source code and tests
   --srcdir     Directory containing source code to mutate
   --testdir    Directory containing the tests to run
   --testfile   Name of the test file to execute, e.g. AllTests.php or all_tests.php
   --test       (PHPUnit only) Name of the test class to run, e.g. MyLibrary_AllTests

If options are omitted, MutateMe will attempt to autodiscover the correct values
using the following conventions:

   1. The base directory is assumed to be the current working directory
   2. The source directory is assumed to be a subdirectory of the base directory
      called either "src", "lib" or "library"
   3. The test directory is assumed to be a subdirectory of the base directory
      called either "tests" or "specs"
   4. The test file is assumed to be either AllTests.php or all_tests.php depending
      on the adapter used
   5. (PHPUnit only) The test class is assumed to be AllTests

If you cannot use these conventions completely, please use the command line options appropriately.

Example:

$ mutateme --adapter phpunit --basedir ./ --srcdir ./src --testdir ./tests --testfile AllTests.php --test MyLib_AllTests

In the example above, we could have omitted the --basedir, --srcdir, --testdir and
--testfile options since they meet the requirements of the autodetectable convention as 
described above.
