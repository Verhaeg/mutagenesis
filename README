This is not yet a functional framework - it's a work in progress

To check the tests, please install Text_Diff from PEAR (otherwise PHPUnit will silently fail (which is MutateMe's fault - not PHPUnit's!)). It's a PHP4 library I need to locate a PHP5 alternative for. Suggestions are welcome! You should also install ext/runkit but NOT from PECL (that's an old version released) - grab the latest CVS version which is compatible with PHP5.2.x
